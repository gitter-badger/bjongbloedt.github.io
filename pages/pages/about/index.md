I am a software professional who has been working in the field since 2013.  I have shifted between working as a manual software tester, to an automated software tester, to a developer, and just about everywhere in between.  I love a good challenge when it comes to my work, and this field has offered me plenty of them.  My hope is that I can document some of those challeges on this blog so that I can remember and maybe save the reader of this blog a bit of time when they come up against the same problem.

I like learning the ins and outs of different programming languages so I have written in quite a few different languages.  These include Java, C#, Python, Nodejs, Go, F#, and a couple others I have played around with a bit.  If I had to pick right now, I would say that I am most comforatble with Python and Nodejs.  I like the Python community and the languages readability vs Java.  I mainly work with nodejs and javascript because the future of the computer seems to be web based, and JS is the toll you have to pay to enter a great ecosystem.  It is rare to find a language that is both super important (try using a website without javscript) and deeply challenging.
